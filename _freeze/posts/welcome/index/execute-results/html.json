With billions of dollars available each year in the U.S., knowing how to navigate and target the right grants is essential. In this blog, we'll take a look at how you can identify key government grant opportunities and focus on the categories that are receiving the most attention in 2024.\n\n# Why Pay Attention to Government Grants?\nGrants can provide essential funding for businesses that might not have enough capital for product development, research, or infrastructure improvements. For example, if you're a start-up with limited cash flow or don't qualify for bank loans, government grants offer a potential lifeline. Understanding what sectors the government prioritizes is key to focusing your efforts on where you're most likely to succeed.\n\n\n\n# Data description\n\n## Data source and data cleaning steps\nThe data is sourced from [TidyTuesday packgae](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-10-03/readme.md) on github.\nThis data set downloaded are then being filtered to only include the posted or \nforecasted grants with close date in 2024 or after, since the point of interest is about what could be\nuseful grant opportunities for our clients. \n\nThe data cleaning steps consist of the following:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#1: First, filter the relevant data\ngrants <- grants %>% filter(opportunity_status!=\"Closed\" & opportunity_status != \"Archived\")\ngrant_detail_24 <- grant_detail %>% filter(current_closing_date_for_applications > 2024)\n\n#2: Making category a variable by pivot longer \ngrants_long <- grant_detail_24 %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = \"category_agriculture\":\"category_other\",  \n    names_to = \"category\",         \n    values_to = \"value\"    \n  ) %>%\n  filter(value == TRUE)\n\n#3: Remove the category prefix in category \ngrants_long <- grants_long %>% mutate(category = gsub(\"category_\", \"\", category))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data variables\nThe main variables used are category of grants, which is classified by the function of grant opportunities.\nEstimated total program funding is another summarising variable to rank the grants, as the more Estimated funding amount in dollars\nfor the grants, the more focus they obtain. Award ceiling and award floor represent the maximum and minimum individual award amount in dollars correspondingly. \n\n# Top 5 grant categories\n\n\n::: {#tbl-topcat .cell tbl-cap='top 5 grant categories'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Top 5 Most Popular Grant Categories\n\n|Category        | Number of Grants|\n|:---------------|----------------:|\n|health          |             1065|\n|education       |              453|\n|science         |              384|\n|environment     |              216|\n|income_security |              177|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet us first have a glance of the categories of grants that are mostly supported.\nIt’s clear from @tbl-topcat that the health sector dominates U.S. government grant funding in 2024, with 1065 grants posted. This reflects a national focus on public health and research into health issues, aiming to improve overall well-being. Innovation in science, including computer science and engineering, also sees substantial investment, indicating the government's emphasis on technological progress. Education, environment, and income security also receive significant attention, reinforcing support for human capital development, environmental protection, and social welfare.\n\n\n\n\n# Top 7 grant opportunities by total estimated program funding\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Top 7 grants by total estimated program funding](index_files/figure-html/fig-topgrant-1.png){#fig-topgrant width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nKnowing which individual grants have the largest funding amounts can help you prioritize your applications. Some grants offer enormous potential for businesses in certain sectors.\n\nHere are some of the biggest opportunities for 2024 in @fig-topgrant:\n\n- **Substantial funds for environment programs**: The first is NCIF, serving with estimated $13.97m to urge\ncompanies to be involved in green capital, climate change and renewable energy projects. \nThis is also aligned with the third and fourth most funded grant, solar for all, \nCCIA together with climate pollution program aiming to lower energy bills and pollution for all. All these environment grants represent a common goal for all companies to contribute to the nationwide \"benefit from the program through energy bill savings,\ncleaner air, job creation, and more.\"(“National Clean Investment Fund | US EPA”)\n- **large Bridge Project Grants**: Apart from sustainable energy projects, bridge investment occupy the second most\nestimated funding grant, which is ideal for infrastructure companies working on\ntransportation, public works, and materials technology. \n- The **Defense Production Act** with estimated $5b funding is prepared to expand domestic production capabilities.\nClients developing new \"Manufacturing & Industrial Technologies\"(Department of Defence)\nand production advancements improving domestic supply chains could be beneficial. \n- **Race to the top fund(ARRA)**: the major grant in education would be estimated\nto fund $4.35b to \"achieve significant improvement in student achievements and outcomes\"(Centre for public impact, 2016).\nEducation innovations and policy deliberations would address the achievement gap\nand prepare pupils for further education and better enter the job market. This would\nbenefit education technology companies.\n\n\nThese most popular funding opportunities might mean that align their projects with the grant requirements would assist them in securing funding, as these grants are deemed as core national objectives. For instance, companies with manufacturing processes \ncould develop innovative solutions in reducing the pollution, applying Climate Pollution\nReduction Grants Program might be a helpful grant.\n\n\n\n\n# Comparing Award Ceilings and Floors by Category\n\nIt’s not just about how much total funding is available—it’s also important to look at the average award sizes for different categories. Some grants offer a high ceiling, meaning they can provide substantial financial support for big projects.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-awards .cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"plotly

ceiling and award floors by category\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Big Winners: Transportation and Environment\nIn @fig-awards, transportation demonstrate the highest difference that soars to around $300 million. This means if you're working on transportation-related projects, you're looking at some serious funding potential. Infrastructure projects, for example, often require large sums, and this category reflects that.\n\nIt is not surprising that Environment follows as another key category with a substantial difference, over $100 million. If you're working in areas like renewable energy or environmental protection, this is where the big bucks are. \nEnergy also shows a notable difference, making it another promising area if your work involves innovative energy solutions.\n\n## Consistent, Smaller Categories\nFor categories like education, employment, and science, the differences between ceilings and floors are much smaller. While these categories may not offer the same massive funding as transportation or environment, they still present great opportunities for projects with more moderate financial needs. These categories are likely to provide more consistent, steady grant sizes, making them ideal for smaller-scale initiatives.\n\n## Other Categories with Potential\nIf your work touches on consumer protection, disaster relief, regional development, or housing, there’s still meaningful funding here, but with more modest ceilings. These categories probably support more focused or smaller-scale projects, but they should not be ignored since there’s still plenty of room to explore.\n\n## Takeaways:\n**Transportation and Environment**: If your project requires big budgets, these are the categories to watch. They’re where the largest funding gaps are, offering major potential if your project aligns.\n\n**Smaller Project**: Categories like education and employment are more stable with consistent funding, making them ideal for smaller, well-defined projects.\n\nSo, depending on your project’s needs, focusing on high-ceiling categories can give you a competitive edge when it comes to scaling, while smaller projects could thrive in categories offering more consistent funding. Knowing where the money is concentrated helps you strategise better and apply for the right grants!\n\n\n# Applying for Grants: What You Need to Know\nWhen applying for grants, keep in mind that competition can be fierce, so it's important to align your project with government priorities. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\n**Target High-Priority Areas**: As seen from the data, health, education, and environmental projects have substantial funding. Focus on these areas if they align with your business goals.\n\n\n**Look at Award Sizes**: Not every grant is going to meet your funding needs. Some grants are tailored for larger, well-established businesses, while others may be a better fit for start-ups or smaller projects.\n\n**Understand the Application Process**: Each grant has its own application requirements. Make sure you’re thoroughly prepared to meet deadlines and submit all necessary documents.\n\n**Stay Innovative**: The government is interested in innovative solutions, whether in technology, infrastructure, or public health. Show how your project stands out from the crowd.\n\n\nGovernment grants play a pivotal role in distributing funding across key sectors of the U.S. economy. With billions of dollars allocated annually, it’s essential for businesses and organizations to identify where the government focuses its investments to make informed decisions on funding applications. Knowing where the money is concentrated helps you craft a smarter grant application strategy. Whether you're aiming for big bucks in infrastructure or seeking steady support for an education initiative, aligning your projects with the right categories is key to securing funding.\n\nReady to apply for a grant?
