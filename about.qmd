# Background

I hold a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Melbourne, where I developed a strong interest in data-driven decision-making. This passion led me to pursue a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University, where I am expanding my expertise in data analysis and business strategy.

I am actively developing key skills in data visualization, data exploration, and statistical thinking, with the goal of applying these tools to solve complex business problems. My background in Finance and Marketing provides me with a unique perspective, allowing me to blend analytical insights with business acumen.

I am eager to leverage my skills to translate data into actionable insights that support strategic growth and enhance business performance. If there are any BA internship opportunities, please contact me via my email: sarahwuliu0917@gmail.com.

# Hobbies

Talking about non-academic life, I enjoy quiet a lot of interests:

- Music: I love listening to all kinds of songs and play piano for more than 10 years, still exploring more themes I can play 
like jazz music other than classical pieces. 

- Badminton: I was in the high school badminton team for two years. 

- Ski: I would also go skiing every winter, it is so excited to fly down the slope to feel the wind and snow. 

- Horse-riding: Another sports I also like is horse-riding, building a connection with the horse is such a 
special experience. 

- Travel: In holidays, I love to travel to countries I have not been 
to, hoping I could experience more different sides of the world. 

- Photography: I am also seeking to take some fabulous photos where possible!
